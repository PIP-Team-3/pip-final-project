# Change Log

Reverse-chronological log of noteworthy backend and process updates. Each entry
links to the detailed write-up in `../history/` when available.

| Date | Area | Update | Details |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 2025-10-19 | Planner | Soft sanitizer rolled out; schema validation still failing on `version` literal. | Blocking note: see `milestones/planner_refactor.md` and `../history/2025-10-19_P2N_Planner_Refactor.md`. |
| 2025-10-19 | Docs | Documentation folder restructured into `current/`, `history/`, `playbooks/`. | You are here â€“ see `../README.md` for navigation. |

Add a new row whenever a code, infra, or process change requires context for the
next engineer. When an entry is superseded, move the detailed artifact into
`../history/` and keep the summary here.
