# Planner Refactor (F1) – Live Summary

- **Scope**: Stabilise the two-stage planner by introducing a post-stage soft
  sanitizer, coercing types, normalising datasets, and downgrading blocked dataset
  guardrails into warnings.
- **Branch**: `clean/phase2-working`
- **Authoritative history**: `../../history/2025-10-19_P2N_Planner_Refactor.md`

## Latest Status ✅ **UNBLOCKED - 2025-10-19**
- ✅ Schema validation fixed: version literal + model parameters now accept correct types
- ✅ Live test passed: CharCNN/SST-2 plan created successfully (`plan_id: df7d3b34...`)
- ✅ Warning system working: Dataset normalization warnings emitted correctly
- ⏳ Additional acceptance tests pending: ResNet/CIFAR-10, MobileNetV2/ImageNet

## What Was Fixed
1. **Version literal**: Added defensive enforcement in router (line 699)
2. **Model parameters schema**: Changed from `Dict[str, float]` to `Dict[str, Any]`
   - Allows lists: `filter_windows: [3, 4, 5]`
   - Allows strings: `activation: "ReLU"`
   - Allows ints/floats: `dropout_rate: 0.5`
3. **Diagnostic logging**: Enhanced error reporting for future debugging

## Remaining Tasks
1. Run additional live tests (ResNet, MobileNetV2) to verify edge cases
2. Consider removing defensive version fix once we confirm sanitizer is stable in production
3. Continue with F2 (registry-only prompts) to reduce warnings

## Dependencies & Next Milestones
- **F2 – Registry-only Planner Mode**: tighten Stage-1 prompt to the dataset registry.
- **F3 – Registry Expansion**: add DBpedia-14, SVHN, and GLUE datasets once F1 is green.
