# Current Documentation Overview

Use this page as the starting point for today’s project context. Everything here
is intended to be “live” and is reviewed whenever the backend changes materially.

- `status_overview.md` – quick brief on project purpose, what’s working, and the
  top open risks you should know about before touching code.
- `milestones/` – one-pagers for active milestones; each links to the full
  historical write-up in `../history/`.
- `changelog.md` – reverse-chronological log of notable changes to architecture,
  policy, or process, with pointers into the archive when you need detail.

Historical notes, full transcripts, and completed milestone deep dives live under
`../history/` (see `../history/INDEX.md` for the catalog).
