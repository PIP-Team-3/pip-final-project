# Documentation Hub

This folder now separates **current references** from the deep archive so you can
tell, at a glance, what is authoritative today.

- `current/` – living docs: status snapshot, active milestones, running change log.
- `history/` – immutable records named `[YYYY-MM-DD]_<slug>.md`, indexed in `history/INDEX.md`.
- `playbooks/` – runbooks and checklists still in rotation.
- `Claudedocs/` – raw session transcripts and large drops; treat these as supplemental.

Start with `current/README.md` for the latest orientation and links.
